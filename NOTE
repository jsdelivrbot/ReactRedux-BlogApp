1. For the routing, we need to put our most specific route on the top 
2. HOW TO CREATE REDUX FORM :
    1. in your reducers/index.js , import Reducer as formReducer from redux-form
       inside the combineReducer, add another object which is form:formReducer
    3. 


3. reduxForm (to connect our form with the reducers):
    we pass a single argument which is a function , this function take some configuration option

4. ReduxForm <Field /> only know how to interract with redux form  , it doesn't know how to
   do JSX (render to the DOM ) , so we use the component props to render the html.
   It can't even handle form submition POST Request to the backend server, so we need to create that ourselves

5. 3 States of redux form:
    1. Pristine : When the form hasn't been clicked or typed (still new)
    2. Touched  : When the form has been clicked 
    3. Invalid  : When the form has an invalid value (already validated)
